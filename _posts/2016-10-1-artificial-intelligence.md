title: Artificial Intelligence - the Terminator or Change Maker of Legal Industry?

One of the most influential events across the world this March would be the Go match between Lee Sedol,
one of the world’s top Go players, and AlphaGo, a specialized artificial intelligence (AI) for Go
developed by Google DeepMind. At first, people were astonished at how well AlphaGo played; then
they were frightened by it, as the AI beats the world champion at 4:1. People once thought that Go was
the most complicated board game ever designed, and that computers would never be able to beat the best
human players, simply because the computational resources required to find a best move is ten of the
six hundred power. Equipped with Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and two powerful neural networks,
AlphaGo can improve itself through learning for other matches and self-play, and is able to acquire a
powerful strategy over variables of exponential growth. This competition between human and machine
forces us to consider several serious problems. Who will control the future world - human or machine?
Will machines seek to enslave or even exterminate human beings? If this day finally comes, how do
people protect themselves?


From a narrower perspective, recent advances in artificial intelligence forces us to think what kind
of career to seek in the future in order not to be surpassed and replaced by artificial intelligence?
It seems obvious that practicing in law is not one of the options.


Let us take a look at the most mundane work in legal practice - writing basic contracts and other
legal documents. It is hard to imagine how many such documents need to be written during one’s entire
career as lawyers, prosecutors or judges, while most of the content are repetitive. Now, these processes
are simplified with automated systems - for example, for an employment contract, the system compiles
the document automatically, where the employee only needs to fill out a questionnaire to provide the
basic information such as name or age. Other more complex documents, including the legal documents
for large loans, can also be completed in such a manner. Legal offices can greatly save the time of their employee by deploying such systems, which in turn saves money for the company itself. As for the standardized documents that are much simple, it is even unnecessary to hire a lawyer for the task. A company called LegalZoom uses this idea to draft legal documents for individuals and small businesses who does not have the financial capacity to employ a lawyer; the services it provides are faster and cheaper - using its online platform, one would only need 15 minutes and 69 dollars to draft a will. Early this May, a law office announced that they would “hire” Ross, an artificial intelligence “lawyer” based on the technologies provided by IBM. Ross’s responsibilities mainly lies in legal search - its human colleagues (usually professional lawyers) will ask questions to it (or should we use “he”?) using natural language, and it will rapidly respond with the precedents and articles with the highest relevance.


Machines can even do more. Last year, Joshua Browder, an undergraduate student from Stanford, created
a website which uses artificial intelligence to answer simple questions about appealing to illegal parking tickets. This year, Joshua improved the website to an artificial lawyer. It will ask the user some questions, collect information, and give out suggestions, such as deciding over whether the user need to appeal, and draft a complete indictment. More interestingly, it can also answer some simple legal questions, such as “I have experienced this accident. How can I request payment from my insurance company?” During the development, the biggest obstacle is to let machines to “understand” how different expressions can have the same meaning. Finally, he used machine learning to allow machines to learn people’s expressions. This would require the machine to extract features from the text, such as keywords and the sequence to perform “self-study”. The more people the system, the more data it obtains and the more comprehensive it will become. The system is not only efficient but also free of charge - until the end of June, Joshua’s machine lawyer has helped people appealed to 160,000 illegal parking tickets, which saved over 4 million US dollars. In other words, the machine lawyer starts its competition with human through “learning” by itself.


These kind of creations are revolutionary. The insurmountable obstacles people once believed during
the automation of law practices will be overcomed in the near future. There are two key technologies
for these tasks - one is the natural language processing capabilities that the machines have yet to
fully possess, the other is the expressing in terms of algorithms “the ability to think as lawyers”,
which legal practitioners take pride in. The only problem between prospect and reality is how developers
can obtain a variety of datasets under the monopoly of publishers such as Thomson Reuters and Elsevier.
Some companies are already pushing towards this directions. A company named Ravel is cooperating with the
Harvard Law School Library, to scan and upload almost all the judicial decisions in American history.
Searching for the results is free - the premium is only required for more complex analysis tools.
The database is still being compiled.


Now, Joshua’s system has made a huge step in terms of natural language processing and algorithms
that “think like lawyers”. These two factors will no longer be obstacles in the near future, especially
when artificial intelligence technology such as AlphaGo is widely utilized. And open-sourcing allows
the law, precedents and standard documents of every country can be accessible and breaks the monopoly
posed by publishers. Legal practitioners, at least people who use law to make a living, can no longer
feel safe under the protection of the expensive legal databases.


Regardless of our expectations, we must admit one possibility that machines will take over most of
the work done by legal practitioners. They will never get tired, are more efficient, does not require
promotions or pay raises, and are more selfless. The lawyers will still be need at court, but the requirements
for junior level lawyers will be greatly reduced. As for judges and prosecutors, the judgement of machine might
not be trusted by the public, but at least it can serve as a reference; the need for judges and prosecutors
will also decline.


These revolutionary changes will indeed frighten law school students. But from another perspective, the
existence of law itself is not intended for providing law students a means to survive, which is never the social
function of law. One of the most important function of the social function of law is to help people resolve conflicts.
And if the development of artificial intelligence can allow conflicts to be resolved more effectively and less
expensive, why is it not a good sign? Take Joshua’s machine lawyer as an example. Up until this August, the
machine lawyer can not only make appeals against illegal parking tickets, but also provide efficient legal
assistance for homeless people in the United Kingdom. This tidal wave of artificial intelligence might
cause law school students to become unemployed, but will benefit the masses as a whole.


Meanwhile, to ensure its survival, law education must discard its old practice teaching simple legal rules,
and adopt new discussions over complex policy research and political problems where the boundary of rules
are blurry. These discussions are what the mainstream law education has been avoiding all the time. Only
through these transformations will the traditional and young subject of law come to a new life.
