        <h6 style="line-height: 140%;">I am an MPP candidate with a law degree and strong quantitative analysis capacities. I have a keen interest in technology policy and anti-discrimination. </h6>
        <h6 style="line-height: 140%;">During my previous professional experiences, I learnt about how laws could be used to promote social equity and justice, thanks to my internships at an international law firm, two United Nations agencies, China's State Council and a legal-aid center. </h6>
        <h6 style="line-height: 140%;">Aside from my belief in the role of law in anti-discrimination and equality, I am always passionate about technology. My undergrad thesis is about open licensing and copyright; I have published one article about the 2017 US self-driving bill and another piece about AI and the legal industry, and I am currently assisting a Berkeley Law Professor with her project on the use of smart software in the court system. Now that I am studying in the Bay area with extensive exposure to rapid technology development, I am hoping to obtain a deeper understanding of technology policy and how that shapes the concept of privacy, freedom of speech and access to authentic information. At the same time, I still have the lasting passion of pursuing social justice and equity. </h6>
